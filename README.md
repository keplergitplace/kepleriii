SE300 Project

Kepler III is a project designed to interpret NASA exosolar system data and create an accurate, simulated model of the various exosolar systems.  In the project's current state, only Earth's solar system can be viewed.

The purpose of this README is to instruct users on how to execute the project in it's current state.

After launching the program, the user will be greeted by a home screen with a series of options.  Currently, only two buttons are functional.  

The "Earth" button displays a semi-scaled version of Earth's solarsystem.  If the user wishes to return to the home screen, click the "Main Menu" button in the top left corner of the screen.  The drop down lists labelled "Planets" and "Stars" list the names of all exoplanets and stars in the solar system, respectively.

The "Exit" button closes the program for the user.
